    content: `# EIP-1: EIP Purpose and Guidelines

## Abstract

An Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) is a design document providing information to the Ethereum community, or describing a new feature for Ethereum or its processes or environment. The EIP should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature.

## Motivation

We intend EIPs to be the primary mechanisms for proposing new features, for collecting community technical input on an issue, and for documenting the design decisions that have gone into Ethereum.

## Specification

### EIP Types

There are three types of EIP:
- **Standards Track EIP**: Describes any change that affects most or all Ethereum implementations
- **Meta EIP**: Describes a process surrounding Ethereum or proposes a change to a process
- **Informational EIP**: Describes an Ethereum design issue, or provides general guidelines or information to the Ethereum community

### EIP Status Terms

- **Idea**: An idea that is pre-draft
- **Draft**: The first formally tracked stage of an EIP in development
- **Review**: An EIP Author marks an EIP as ready for and requesting Peer Review
- **Last Call**: This is the final review window for an EIP before moving to FINAL
- **Final**: This EIP represents the final standard
- **Stagnant**: Any EIP in Draft or Review if inactive for a period of 6 months or greater
- **Withdrawn**: The EIP Author(s) have withdrawn the proposed EIP
- **Living**: A special status for EIPs that are designed to be continually updated`,

## Abstract

This EIP describes the recommended process that EIP Editors should use for EIP management and EIP editing.

## Motivation

The EIP editing process has evolved organically over time. This EIP aims to document the current best practices and provide guidance for new EIP editors.

## Specification

### Editor Responsibilities

EIP editors are responsible for:
- Managing the EIP repository
- Reviewing EIP submissions for formatting and content
- Assigning EIP numbers
- Updating EIP status
- Facilitating the EIP process

### Review Process

1. **Initial Review**: Check for proper formatting and basic requirements
2. **Technical Review**: Ensure technical accuracy and completeness
3. **Community Review**: Facilitate community discussion and feedback
4. **Final Review**: Prepare EIP for final status`,

    content: `# EIP-1559: Fee market change for ETH 1.0 chain

## Abstract

This EIP introduces a new transaction pricing mechanism that includes a fixed-per-block network fee that is burned and dynamically expands/contracts block sizes to deal with transient congestion.

## Motivation

Ethereum currently prices transaction fees using a simple auction mechanism, where users send transactions with bids ("gasprices") and miners choose transactions with the highest bids...

## Specification

The base fee is calculated as follows:

\`\`\`
base_fee = parent_base_fee * (1 + (parent_gas_used - parent_gas_target) / parent_gas_target / BASE_FEE_MAX_CHANGE_DENOMINATOR)
\`\`\`

Where:
- \`BASE_FEE_MAX_CHANGE_DENOMINATOR = 8\`
- \`parent_gas_target = parent_gas_limit / 2\`

## Rationale

This mechanism aims to make transaction fees more predictable while still maintaining the incentive structure for miners.`,

## Abstract

This EIP deprecates Proof-of-Work (PoW) and activates Proof-of-Stake (PoS) as part of the Merge.

## Motivation

The Merge represents the most significant upgrade in the history of Ethereum. It deprecates proof-of-work, the Nakamoto consensus algorithm that has secured the network since genesis, and activates proof-of-stake in its place.

## Specification

### Transition Process

1. **Terminal Total Difficulty**: Set to 58750000000000000000000
2. **Merge Block**: First block with difficulty = 0
3. **Consensus Layer Integration**: Beacon chain becomes the consensus layer

## Abstract

Introduce a new transaction type for "blob-carrying transactions" which contain a large amount of data that cannot be accessed by EVM execution, but whose commitment can be accessed.

## Motivation

Rollups are in the short and medium term, and possibly the long term, the only trustless scaling solution for Ethereum. Transaction fees on rollups are primarily determined by the cost of data posted on chain.

## Specification

### Blob Transaction Type

A new transaction type with the following fields:
- \`chain_id\`: Chain ID
- \`nonce\`: Account nonce  
- \`max_priority_fee_per_gas\`: Maximum priority fee per gas
- \`max_fee_per_gas\`: Maximum total fee per gas
- \`gas_limit\`: Gas limit
- \`to\`: Destination address
- \`value\`: ETH value
- \`data\`: Transaction data
- \`access_list\`: EIP-2930 access list

## Abstract

This EIP adds precompiled contracts for BLS12-381 curve operations, enabling efficient BLS signature verification, aggregation, and other advanced cryptographic operations on Ethereum.

## Motivation

BLS12-381 is a pairing-friendly elliptic curve that enables:
- BLS signature aggregation (used in Ethereum 2.0)
- Zero-knowledge proof systems
- Advanced cryptographic protocols
- Efficient multi-signature schemes

## Specification

### Precompiled Contracts

Four new precompiled contracts are added:

1. **BLS12_G1ADD** (0x0b): G1 point addition
2. **BLS12_G1MUL** (0x0c): G1 scalar multiplication  
3. **BLS12_G2ADD** (0x0d): G2 point addition
4. **BLS12_G2MUL** (0x0e): G2 scalar multiplication
5. **BLS12_PAIRING** (0x0f): Pairing operation

### Gas Costs

- G1 addition: 500 gas
- G1 multiplication: 12,000 gas
- G2 addition: 800 gas
- G2 multiplication: 45,000 gas
- Pairing: 43,000 + 65,000 * k gas (k = number of pairs)

## Rationale

These precompiles enable efficient implementation of BLS signatures and other advanced cryptographic protocols that are essential for Ethereum's roadmap and Layer 2 scaling solutions.`,

## Abstract

An account abstraction proposal which completely avoids the need for consensus-layer protocol changes. Instead of adding new protocol features and changing the existing validation logic, this proposal introduces a higher-layer pseudo-transaction object called a UserOperation...

## Motivation

Account abstraction allows users to use smart contract wallets containing arbitrary verification logic instead of EOAs as their primary account.

    content: `# EIP-7702: Set EOA account code for one transaction

## Abstract

This EIP introduces a new transaction type that allows externally owned accounts (EOAs) to temporarily set code for the duration of one transaction. This enables account abstraction features like sponsored transactions, batched operations, and custom validation logic while maintaining full backward compatibility.

## Motivation

Account abstraction has been a long-sought goal for Ethereum, but previous approaches required significant protocol changes or new account types. EIP-7702 provides a minimal, backward-compatible path to account abstraction by allowing EOAs to temporarily "become" smart contracts for single transactions.

## Specification

### New Transaction Type

A new transaction type \`0x04\` is introduced with the following fields:
- \`chain_id\`: Chain identifier
- \`nonce\`: Account nonce
- \`max_priority_fee_per_gas\`: Maximum priority fee
- \`max_fee_per_gas\`: Maximum total fee
- \`gas_limit\`: Gas limit
- \`to\`: Destination address
- \`value\`: ETH value
- \`data\`: Transaction data
- \`authorization_list\`: List of authorization tuples

### Authorization Tuple

Each authorization tuple contains:
- \`chain_id\`: Target chain ID
- \`address\`: Address to authorize
- \`nonce\`: Authorization nonce
- \`y_parity\`, \`r\`, \`s\`: ECDSA signature components

## Rationale

This approach provides immediate account abstraction benefits while maintaining the existing EOA infrastructure. It enables:
- Sponsored transactions (gasless transactions)
- Batched operations
- Custom validation logic
- Gradual migration to full account abstraction`,

    description: "Enable voluntary exits of validators to be triggered from the execution layer, providing more flexible validator management.",
    content: `# EIP-7251: Execution Layer Exit

## Abstract

This EIP introduces a mechanism for validators to trigger voluntary exits from the execution layer rather than requiring consensus layer operations. This provides more flexibility for staking protocols and validator management systems.

## Motivation

Currently, validator exits must be initiated from the consensus layer using signed voluntary exit messages. This creates operational complexity for staking protocols and limits the ability to automate validator lifecycle management from smart contracts.

## Specification

### New Precompile

A new precompile at address \`0x0C\` is introduced to handle execution layer exits:

\`\`\`
function requestExit(
    bytes calldata pubkey,
    uint64 validatorIndex,
    bytes calldata signature
) external
\`\`\`

### Exit Request Processing

Exit requests are processed during block execution and included in the beacon chain state transition. The execution layer maintains a queue of pending exit requests that are processed by the consensus layer.

## Rationale

This design enables:
- Smart contract-based validator management
- Automated exit strategies for staking protocols  
- Simplified operational procedures for large validator sets
- Better integration between execution and consensus layers`,

    content: `# EIP-6900: Modular Smart Contract Accounts and Plugins

## Abstract

This proposal standardizes smart contract accounts with a modular plugin architecture, enabling enhanced functionality while maintaining interoperability across different account implementations.

## Motivation

Current smart contract wallets lack standardization, making it difficult to:
- Share plugins across different wallet implementations
- Ensure security and compatibility
- Enable ecosystem-wide innovation

## Specification

### Account Interface

\`\`\`solidity
interface IModularAccount {
    function installPlugin(address plugin, bytes calldata initData) external;
    function uninstallPlugin(address plugin, bytes calldata deinitData) external;
    function executeFromPlugin(bytes calldata data) external payable returns (bytes memory);
}
\`\`\`

### Plugin Types

1. **Validation Plugins**: Custom signature validation logic
2. **Execution Plugins**: Additional account functionality
3. **Hook Plugins**: Pre/post execution hooks

## Security Considerations

- Plugin isolation and permission management
- Upgrade mechanisms and governance
- Compatibility verification`,

    content: `# EIP-998: Composable Non-Fungible Token Standard

## Abstract

This standard extends ERC-721 to enable NFTs to own other NFTs and ERC-20 tokens, creating composable digital assets.

## Motivation

Current NFT standards don't support ownership relationships between tokens. This limits the creation of complex digital assets that could represent:
- Characters with equipment in games
- Portfolios containing multiple assets
- Hierarchical organizational structures

## Specification

## Abstract

This EIP specifies a standard interface for voting systems, enabling interoperable governance mechanisms across different platforms and applications.

## Motivation

Voting is a fundamental component of governance systems. A standard interface would enable:
- Interoperability between different voting platforms
- Standardized tooling for vote analysis
- Composable governance systems

    content: `# EIP-86: Abstraction of transaction origin and signature

## Abstract

This EIP proposes changes that would allow contracts to pay for gas and customize transaction validation logic.

## Motivation

Currently, all transactions must be signed by an externally owned account and pay gas fees. This limits flexibility in account management and user experience.

## Specification

1. Allow contracts to pay for gas via a new opcode
2. Enable custom signature validation in contracts
3. Modify transaction format to support contract-originated transactions

## Abstract

This EIP introduces subroutines and static jumps to the EVM, enabling better code organization and potential gas savings.

## Motivation

Current EVM jump instructions are dynamic and expensive to validate. Static jumps and subroutines would:
- Improve code readability and organization
- Enable better compiler optimizations
- Reduce gas costs for certain operations

## Specification

### New Opcodes

- \`JUMPSUB\`: Jump to subroutine
- \`RETURNSUB\`: Return from subroutine
- \`JUMPSUBV\`: Jump to subroutine with validation

### Static Analysis

All jump destinations must be statically determinable at deploy time.

Note: This proposal has been inactive and may be superseded by other EVM improvements.`,

## Abstract

This EIP proposes to restore the contract code at address 0x863DF6BFa4469f3ead0bE8f9F2AAE51c91A907b4 to recover funds locked in Parity multi-signature wallets.

## Motivation

On November 6, 2017, a user accidentally triggered a bug in the Parity wallet library contract, causing it to be destroyed and locking approximately 513,774.16 Ether in 587 wallets.

## Specification

Restore the contract code at the specified address to its state before the incident.

## Status

This EIP was withdrawn due to lack of consensus and concerns about:
- Immutability of the blockchain
- Precedent for future interventions
- Technical complexity of implementation

The proposal highlighted important debates about blockchain governance and immutability.`,
