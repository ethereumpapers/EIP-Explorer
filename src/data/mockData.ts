    content: `# EIP-1: EIP Purpose and Guidelines

## Abstract

An Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) is a design document providing information to the Ethereum community, or describing a new feature for Ethereum or its processes or environment. The EIP should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature.

## Motivation

We intend EIPs to be the primary mechanisms for proposing new features, for collecting community technical input on an issue, and for documenting the design decisions that have gone into Ethereum.

## Specification

### EIP Types

There are three types of EIP:
- **Standards Track EIP**: Describes any change that affects most or all Ethereum implementations
- **Meta EIP**: Describes a process surrounding Ethereum or proposes a change to a process
- **Informational EIP**: Describes an Ethereum design issue, or provides general guidelines or information to the Ethereum community

### EIP Status Terms

- **Idea**: An idea that is pre-draft
- **Draft**: The first formally tracked stage of an EIP in development
- **Review**: An EIP Author marks an EIP as ready for and requesting Peer Review
- **Last Call**: This is the final review window for an EIP before moving to FINAL
- **Final**: This EIP represents the final standard
- **Stagnant**: Any EIP in Draft or Review if inactive for a period of 6 months or greater
- **Withdrawn**: The EIP Author(s) have withdrawn the proposed EIP
- **Living**: A special status for EIPs that are designed to be continually updated`,

## Specification

1. The gas cost for creating contracts via a transaction is increased from 21,000 to 53,000
2. All transaction signatures whose s-value is greater than secp256k1n/2 are now considered invalid
3. If contract creation does not have enough gas to pay for the final account creation, it goes out-of-gas rather than leaving an empty account
4. Change the difficulty adjustment algorithm`,

## Abstract

The following standard allows for the implementation of a standard API for tokens within smart contracts. This standard provides basic functionality to transfer tokens, as well as allow tokens to be approved so they can be spent by another on-chain third party.

## Motivation

A standard interface allows any tokens on Ethereum to be re-used by other applications: from wallets to decentralized exchanges.

## Abstract

A standard interface for non-fungible tokens, also known as deeds.

## Abstract

A standard interface for contracts that manage multiple token types. A single deployed contract may include any combination of fungible tokens, non-fungible tokens or other configurations (e.g. semi-fungible tokens).

## Motivation

Tokens standards like ERC-20 and ERC-721 require a separate contract to be deployed for each token type or collection. This places a lot of redundant bytecode on the Ethereum blockchain and limits certain functionality by the nature of separating each token contract into its own permissioned address.

    content: `# EIP-1559: Fee market change for ETH 1.0 chain

## Abstract

This EIP introduces a new transaction pricing mechanism that includes a fixed-per-block network fee that is burned and dynamically expands/contracts block sizes to deal with transient congestion.

## Motivation

Ethereum currently prices transaction fees using a simple auction mechanism, where users send transactions with bids ("gasprices") and miners choose transactions with the highest bids, and transactions that get included pay the bid that they specify.

## Specification

### Parameters

- \`FORK_BLOCK_NUMBER\`: TBD
- \`BASE_FEE_MAX_CHANGE_DENOMINATOR\`: 8
- \`ELASTICITY_MULTIPLIER\`: 2

### Base Fee

The base fee is calculated as follows:

\`\`\`
base_fee = parent_base_fee * (1 + (parent_gas_used - parent_gas_target) / parent_gas_target / BASE_FEE_MAX_CHANGE_DENOMINATOR)
\`\`\`

Where:
- \`parent_gas_target = parent_gas_limit / ELASTICITY_MULTIPLIER\`

## Rationale

This mechanism aims to make transaction fees more predictable while still maintaining the incentive structure for miners.`,

    content: `# EIP-2981: NFT Royalty Standard

## Abstract

This standard allows contracts, such as NFTs that support ERC-721 and ERC-1155 interfaces, to signal a royalty amount to be paid to the NFT creator or rights holder every time the NFT is sold or re-sold.

## Motivation

There are many marketplaces for NFTs with wide variability in how they identify and pay royalties to creators. The royalty payment must be voluntary, as transfer mechanisms such as transferFrom() include NFT transfers between wallets, and executing them does not always imply a sale occurred.

## Abstract

This EIP deprecates Proof-of-Work (PoW) and activates Proof-of-Stake (PoS) as part of the Merge.

## Motivation

The Merge is the long-awaited transition of Ethereum from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake consensus. This transition will:
- Reduce Ethereum's energy consumption by ~99.95%
- Set the stage for future scaling upgrades
- Improve the security and decentralization of the network

## Specification

### Transition Process

1. The transition is triggered by reaching a specific Total Terminal Difficulty (TTD)
2. Once TTD is reached, the execution layer stops producing PoW blocks
3. The consensus layer (Beacon Chain) takes over block production
4. Validators replace miners as block producers

### Changes to Block Structure

- Remove PoW-specific fields (mixHash, nonce)
- Add new fields for PoS consensus
- Modify block validation rules`,

## Abstract

Introduce a new transaction type for "blob-carrying transactions" which contain a large amount of data that cannot be accessed by EVM execution, but whose commitment can be accessed.

## Motivation

Rollups are in the short and medium term, and possibly the long term, the only trustless scaling solution for Ethereum. Transaction fees on rollups are primarily determined by the cost of data availability on the base layer.

## Abstract

An account abstraction proposal which completely avoids the need for consensus-layer protocol changes. Instead of adding new protocol features and changing the existing validation logic, this proposal introduces a higher-layer pseudo-transaction object called a UserOperation.

## Motivation

Account abstraction allows users to use smart contract wallets containing arbitrary verification logic instead of EOAs as their primary account.

## Specification

### Definitions

- **UserOperation** - a structure that describes a transaction to be sent on behalf of a user
- **Bundler** - a node that can handle UserOperations  
- **EntryPoint** - a singleton contract that executes bundles of UserOperations
- **Paymaster** - a contract that can sponsor gas fees for UserOperations
- **Aggregator** - a contract that can validate signatures for multiple UserOperations

    content: `# EIP-7702: Set EOA account code for one transaction

## Abstract

This EIP introduces a new transaction type that allows externally owned accounts (EOAs) to temporarily set code for the duration of one transaction. This enables account abstraction features like sponsored transactions, batched operations, and custom validation logic while maintaining full backward compatibility.

## Motivation

Account abstraction has been a long-sought goal for Ethereum, but previous approaches required significant protocol changes or new account types. EIP-7702 provides a minimal, backward-compatible path to account abstraction by allowing EOAs to temporarily "become" smart contracts for single transactions.

## Specification

### New Transaction Type

A new transaction type \`0x04\` is introduced with the following fields:
- \`chain_id\`: Chain identifier
- \`nonce\`: Account nonce
- \`max_priority_fee_per_gas\`: Maximum priority fee
- \`max_fee_per_gas\`: Maximum total fee
- \`gas_limit\`: Gas limit
- \`to\`: Destination address
- \`value\`: ETH value
- \`data\`: Transaction data
- \`authorization_list\`: List of authorization tuples

### Authorization Tuple

Each authorization tuple contains:
- \`chain_id\`: Target chain ID
- \`address\`: Address to authorize
- \`nonce\`: Authorization nonce
- \`y_parity\`, \`r\`, \`s\`: ECDSA signature components

## Rationale

This approach provides immediate account abstraction benefits while maintaining the existing EOA infrastructure. It enables:
- Sponsored transactions (gasless transactions)
- Batched operations
- Custom validation logic
- Gradual migration to full account abstraction`,

    description: "Enable voluntary exits of validators to be triggered from the execution layer, providing more flexible validator management.",
    content: `# EIP-7251: Execution Layer Exit

## Abstract

This EIP introduces a mechanism for validators to trigger voluntary exits from the execution layer rather than requiring consensus layer operations. This provides more flexibility for staking protocols and validator management systems.

## Motivation

Currently, validator exits must be initiated from the consensus layer using signed voluntary exit messages. This creates operational complexity for staking protocols and limits the ability to automate validator lifecycle management from smart contracts.

## Specification

### New Precompile

A new precompile at address \`0x0C\` is introduced to handle execution layer exits:

\`\`\`
function requestExit(
    bytes calldata pubkey,
    uint64 validatorIndex,
    bytes calldata signature
) external
\`\`\`

### Exit Request Processing

Exit requests are processed during block execution and included in the beacon chain state transition. The execution layer maintains a queue of pending exit requests that are processed by the consensus layer.

## Rationale

This design enables:
- Smart contract-based validator management
- Automated exit strategies for staking protocols  
- Simplified operational procedures for large validator sets
- Better integration between execution and consensus layers`,

    content: `# EIP-2537: Precompile for BLS12-381 curve operations

## Abstract

This EIP adds precompiled contracts for BLS12-381 curve operations, enabling efficient BLS signature verification, aggregation, and other advanced cryptographic operations on Ethereum.

## Motivation

BLS12-381 is a pairing-friendly elliptic curve that enables:
- BLS signature aggregation (used in Ethereum 2.0)
- Zero-knowledge proof systems
- Advanced cryptographic protocols
- Efficient multi-signature schemes

## Specification

### Precompiled Contracts

Four new precompiled contracts are added:

1. **BLS12_G1ADD** (0x0b): G1 point addition
2. **BLS12_G1MUL** (0x0c): G1 scalar multiplication  
3. **BLS12_G2ADD** (0x0d): G2 point addition
4. **BLS12_G2MUL** (0x0e): G2 scalar multiplication
5. **BLS12_PAIRING** (0x0f): Pairing operation

### Gas Costs

- G1 addition: 500 gas
- G1 multiplication: 12,000 gas
- G2 addition: 800 gas
- G2 multiplication: 45,000 gas
- Pairing: 43,000 + 65,000 * k gas (k = number of pairs)

## Rationale

These precompiles enable efficient implementation of BLS signatures and other advanced cryptographic protocols that are essential for Ethereum's roadmap and Layer 2 scaling solutions.`,

## Abstract

This EIP introduces subroutines and static jumps to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) to improve code organization, readability, and gas efficiency.

## Motivation

The current EVM lacks subroutines, making code organization difficult and leading to code duplication. This proposal adds:
- JUMPSUB instruction for calling subroutines
- RETURNSUB instruction for returning from subroutines
- Static jump validation at deploy time

## Specification

### New Instructions

- \`JUMPSUB (0x5e)\`: Jump to subroutine
- \`RETURNSUB (0x5f)\`: Return from subroutine

### Validation

All jumps must be validated at contract deployment time to ensure:
- Valid jump destinations
- Proper subroutine structure
- Stack consistency`,
